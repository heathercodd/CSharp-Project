"# CSharp-Project" 

Project Overview:
Using C#, create a console application which allows a user to interact with a MySql database containing sales information (SaleID, Product Name, Quantity, Price, SaleDate).
Within the application, the user must be able to select "Data Entry" (to add a new sales record to the database) or "Reports" (to select and view a report).
Reports the user should be able to view are: Sales by Year, Sales by Month and Year, Total Sales by Year , Total Sales by Year and Month, All sales between two specified years (inclusive), All sales between two specified years and months (inclusive), The average sales for a given month over a specified amount of years, The average sales per month for a specified year, The month of a specified year that made the most sales, The month of a specified year that made the least sales. 

Why are we doing this project?
To consolidate and demonstrate our knowledge of C# and MySql after the QA Academy.

How I expected the challenge to go:
I expected the challenge to be fun but difficult to complete. I was pleasantly surprised at having to ask for guidance a lot less than I expected to.

What went well?
Both the C# and the SQL sections of the project work as expected, including the should-haves as well as the must-haves.
I was able to de-bug my own code and use Google or the QA resources for solutions to any problems.

What did not go as planned?
Getting the essential functionality for the project completely working took me a while, which meant that I did not have as much time to include further functionality that I would have liked to explore - see below.

Possible improvements for the future:
Possible improvements with more time would be adding a "delete data" method, and exploring some better linking in the project, so that users could return to the main menu or report submenu at any point. 

Notable Mentions: 
I could not have successfully completed this project without the teaching and the example code provided by Morgan Walsh (QA Academy).
